# TheKeepMC Denizen Scripts
## Introduction 
TheKeepMC is a currently in-development minecraft server. 
It utilizes various plugins for basic functionalities but
relies almost entirely on Denizen for its most important features,
including...
- Quests
- Classes
- Spellcasting
- Bloods (races)
- Professions
- Skills
- Shops
- Travel
- Custom items
- and countless others..
  
The server is an economy server at heart, heavily influenced by RPG elements
and the infinite possibilities offered to each player in the future. They
will choose whether to join their friends in completing dungeons for a quest item, become
powerful spellcasters or quickshot archers, make offerings to the deities of their choosing
and receive blessings in return, or live as simple farmers and miners in their quiet Towny village.
## Why post these scripts?
I am new to the development world but have always loved it.
Being my first experience and what led me to begin contributing
to and writing my own Java projects, I decided that for now
I would make my scripts public for comments, suggestions, contributions,
and criticism.
